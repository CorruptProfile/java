Hello team leads,
 
I have BCC’d you all on this email (I know some people are protective of their contact information, so I didn’t want to just send it to all the other leads).
I told you that I would let you know what to name your return methods, and that is what this email is for.
 
 
getTimeOne()
                Will return the time it takes to find your integers in the first array
getTimeTwo()
                Will return the time it takes to find your integers in the seconds array
getTimeThree()
                Will return the time it takes to find your integers in the third array
getValuesOne()
                Will return the two integers that you were looking for in array1 as a two element array of type int
getValuesTwo()
                Will return the two integers that you were looking for in array2 as a two element array of type int
getValuesThree()
                Will return the two integers that you were looking for in array3 as a two element array of type int
 
 
Team2 will also have the method getSortTime() which will return the time it takes to sort the arrayList.
Team8 will also have the method getCollisions() which will return the number of collisions they counted.
 
 
If there are any issues, or any errors in what data I am expecting from each team, please let me know as soon as possible.
 
 
Daniel Ciesielski
